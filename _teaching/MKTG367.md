"This course will provide students with an overview of the rapidly-emerging field of digital marketing. Since digital marketing is constantly changing, students will become proficient at learning about new digital marketing platforms, how each channel is used to communicate with customers and be able to develop a list of key questions to ask about any new marketing medium. Because data and analytics are an important component of digital marketing, students will also become proficient at using data to evaluate a marketing campaign. One of the best ways to assess marketing strategies is through A/B testing and students will become expert at planning, analyzing and reporting A/B tests. We will also discuss strategies for integrating data-based decision making into organizations."
