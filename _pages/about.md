Welcome! I'm Morgan, a fourth year Ph.D. student in Quantitative Marketing at Drexel University. I enjoy researching consumers, brands, and retailers using quantitative methods (e.g. Bayesian Statistics). I grew up in West Palm Beach, FL so I love the sunshine and going to the beach. I have two daughters who keep me busy! 

## Research

My research interests are both substantive and methodological. I am currently researching the relationship between consumers, brands, and retailers through observational data, although I am also interested in advertising and digital marketing. I specialize in using consumer panel and grocery sales data. Methodologically I am currently focused on synthetic control methods, Bayesian statistics, Differences in Differences, and Gaussian copulas (causal inference). 

In my dissertation, "Measuring the Interrelationships between Consumers, Brands, and Retailers using Bayesian Models", I study three topics. The first project introduces a novel model for measuring dynamic brand equity, capturing the relationship between consumers and brands. My second project studies empirical category captainship across multiple grocery product categories to understand how store and category characteristics influence the success of this category management technique (relationship between retailers and brands). Finally, the goal of my third project (very early stages) is to provide firms with a novel measurement of consumer loyalty at the retailer level using their readily available sales data (relationship between consumers and retailers). More detail on these projects is provided under the "Research" tab above. 

I am advised by [Dr. Elea Feit](https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/eleafeit), whose feedback and support has been instrumental in guiding me through the Ph.D.

## Background

I received a B.S. in Economics from Brigham Young University Provo in 2017. During my time there, I worked with [Dr. Jeff Dotson](https://marriott.byu.edu/directory/details?id=33658) on the previously mentioned Category Captainship project. Following my undergraduate education at BYU, I received a M.S. in Economics from Purdue University in 2019 (online program). I began my Ph.D. training at Drexel in August of 2019.
