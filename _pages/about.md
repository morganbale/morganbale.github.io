Welcome! I'm Morgan Rhodes Bale, a fourth year Ph.D. student in Quantitative Marketing at Drexel University. I enjoy researching consumers, brands, and retailers using quantitative methods (e.g. Bayesian Statistics). I grew up in West Palm Beach, FL so I love the sunshine and going to the beach. I have two daughters who keep me busy! 

## Research

My research interests are both substantive and methodological. I research the relationships between consumers, brands, and retailers, although I am also interested in advertising and digital marketing. I specialize in using consumer panel and grocery sales data. Methodologically, I use causal inference to understand the world, my current focus is synthetic control methods, Bayesian statistics, Differences in Differences, and Gaussian copulas. 

My coauthors and I recently published a paper in *Expert Systems with Applications* in which we protect the identities of the authors of online reviews by generating synthetic attributes (e.g., location and rating) to accompany their posts.

In my dissertation, "Measuring the Interrelationships between Consumers, Brands, and Retailers using Bayesian Models", I study three topics. The first project introduces a novel model for measuring dynamic brand equity, capturing the relationship between consumers and brands. My second project studies empirical category captainship across multiple grocery product categories to understand how store and category characteristics influence the success of this category management technique. Finally, the goal of my third project (very early stages) is to provide firms with a novel measurement of consumer loyalty at the retailer level using their readily available sales data. More detail on these projects is provided under "Research" tab above. 

I am advised by [Dr. Elea Feit](https://www.lebow.drexel.edu/people/eleafeit), whose feedback and support has been instrumental in guiding me through the Ph.D.

## Background

I received a B.S. in Economics from Brigham Young University Provo in 2017. During my time there, I worked with [Dr. Jeff Dotson](https://marriott.byu.edu/directory/details?id=33658) on the previously mentioned Category Captainship project. Following my undergraduate education at BYU, I received a M.S. in Economics from Purdue University in 2019 (online program). I began my Ph.D. training at Drexel in August of 2019.
