Abstract: "This paper makes use of Nielsen data to investigate the generalizability of category captainship and its impact on retailers. Category captainship is when a retailer selects a category captain to manage the product line assortment and optimization for all of the brands within a category, including the retailer’s private label and captain’s own brand. This has been shown to be optimal for the retailer and the captain and not as detrimental to the other brands as might be expected. But does this phenomenon generalize across many retailers? What characteristics attenuate the success of the practice across retailers?"
