In this post, I test the Bayesian Synthetic Control Model presented in Kim et al (2020) using both simulated data and the "smoking" data set from Abadie et al (2010). The BSC.pdf slides provide background on synthetic controls, compare standard synthetic control to BSCM and explain the example provided in the markdown file "bscm_class_example.md". References are provided at the end of the pdf slides.
